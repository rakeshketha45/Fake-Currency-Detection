# Fake-Currency-Detection
A machine learning–based classification system to detect counterfeit banknotes using statistical feature analysis.


📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying fake currency notes by analyzing specific statistical features extracted from scanned images. Using a well-known banknote authentication dataset, the model classifies notes as genuine or counterfeit based on features such as variance, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy of wavelet-transformed images.
